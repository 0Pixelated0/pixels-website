				<p>Given everything that's been happening, I wanted to share why I dont discuss politics <br>
					As an Israeli, I know my nationality might make you feel unsafe (for some), <br>
					so here's why it's important not to judge me based on that.</p>
				<h1>My goal</h1>
				<p>My goal is to connect with people and share ideas.<br>
					Politics are mostly conterversial and involve where people come from,<br>
					What i am saying is that my goals conflict with what politics makes people think of others.
				</p>
				<h1>No discrimination</h1>
				<p>Judging people by their nationality is like judging people by the color of their skin,<br>
					People are more than what country they we're born in (or what they think of other countries).<br>
					For example...<br>
					You probably found this page on one of my internet profiles,<br> 
					which means we have something in common more than politics
				</p>
				<h1>Respecting all views</h1>
				<p>We all have different political views,<br>
					some of us lean one way and some the opposite, most people stay neutral<br>
					by not discussing politics, i am avoiding future contreversies and respecting everyone
